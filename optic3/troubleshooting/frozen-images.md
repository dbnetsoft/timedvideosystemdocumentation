# Frozen images

In case a camera is showing a frozen frame and not live image anymore, check the following:

Go to the camera's website. If you see a video there, you may need to reconnect the camera in the TimedVideoSystem software - or best restart software. The frames should start appearing again.&#x20;

If the frame is also frozen or completely missing on the camera's website, you can upload debug information to ALGE for further investigation. But for this to work the camera needs to have access to internet, so a correct gateway and DNS server must be set upfront. If this is the case, you can upload debug information wit this button:&#x20;
