# Common Mistakes

#### Timy shows PULSE HOLD L0

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Timy indicates a short on the line on C0/Start channel. This is either when a banana cable is touching together or the polarity on the cable is not right.&#x20;

Make sure to have all GND connected together and all others connected together. E.g. to Opti's make sure that all green connectors go together and all black connectors.
