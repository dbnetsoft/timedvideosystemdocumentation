## New Sync Window

OptiC3 sometimes will not accept a request to sync to next impulse. Therefore it is recommended to power-cycle OptiC3 before syncing. However, still the process of syncing all cameras together is now streamlined into a new window:&#x20;

Software will now guide through the steps involved:&#x20;

* Enter a sync time and hit Enter or click the button
* All cameras should display `Waiting for sync impulse`
* When the sync impulse happen, all cameras should report `Synced to` - if not the sync failed for one or more cameras. In this case restart all cameras and start over.
* After a successful sync, it is best to make another check impulse after 1 minute after sync
* If this test shows the same check impulse time for all cameras then the sync can be considered successful
